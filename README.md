## **Project Goal**
The aim of this project is to segment customers based on age, income, and spending habits, allowing for more targeted marketing, enhanced customer satisfaction, and efficient resource use.

## **Techniques Used**
I used clustering techniques to analyze the data and uncover patterns, focusing on age, annual income, and spending score.

## **Findings and Recommendations**

***Cluster 1: Age varies, low income, medium spending***: These customers have limited income but a moderate spending score.
-> Recommendation: 
- Offer budget-friendly products and seasonal discounts in key departments to encourage frequent visits and repeat purchases.
- Use targeted campaigns highlighting affordable quality and convenience.

***Cluster 2: Young, high income, high spending***: This group is young and affluent, willing to spend on premium products.
Recommendation: 
- Create VIP experiences with early access to new collections, premium product lines, and invite-only events.
- Implement personalized loyalty benefits to drive continued high-value engagement.

***Cluster 3: Young, low income, high spending***: Despite low income, this group has a high spending score, suggesting aspirational buying.
Recommendation:
- Stock trendy yet affordable brands and introduce flexible payment options like installment plans to match their preferences.
- Engage with targeted digital marketing featuring popular, aspirational items.
  
***Cluster 4: Age varies, moderate income, low spending***: These customers have moderate income but lower spending habits, likely indicating budget-consciousness.
Recommendation: 
- Highlight value-oriented products and focus on “quality-for-price” messaging.
- Use promotions that emphasize long-lasting quality and utility, and consider implementing loyalty discounts on necessities to boost engagement.

***Cluster 5: Young, moderate income, high spending***: This segment is young with moderate income but willing to spend more for quality.
Recommendation: 
- Emphasize mid-tier products that balance quality and affordability, and use limited-time discounts on premium items to attract them to higher-value purchases.
- Focus on campaigns that appeal to quality-conscious young professionals.

***Cluster 6: Age varies, lowest income, lowest spending***: With the lowest income and spending, this group is the most budget-conscious.
- Focus on essential or budget product lines and promote value-based marketing messaging.
- Highlight “best deals” across essential items and consider loyalty programs that reward frequent, small purchases.
